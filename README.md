# fitness-tracker

For this application, I built off of starter code to enable a fitness tracker.  The user is able to log their workouts: resistance or cardio.  They are asked to input the name and duration for all workouts.  Then, based on the type of workout, they either enter distance (for cardio workouts) or weight, sets, and reps (for resistance workouts).  They can also view their dashboard, which stores and compiles their workout details, then displays it in a variety of graph formats.
